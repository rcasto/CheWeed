CheWeed
=======
To get CheWeed up and running on your computer follow the steps written below.

You must first make sure you have Node.js installed.  Node.js should come installed with npm (node package manager), but if not
you can download npm <a href="https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/master/README.md">here</a>.

With these dependencies now installed, navigate to the CheWeed directory with the command prompt and run the
<code>npm install</code> command. This command will fetch the node modules that CheWeed depends upon.  

The <code>npm install</code> command will also automatically run the <code>bower install</code> command for you. This command will fetch the client side modules that CheWeed depends upon such as <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>.

After this all the dependencies necessary to run CheWeed on your computer will be installed.  You can run CheWeed now by executing the <code>npm start</code> command within the CheWeed directory in the command prompt.

Now navigate to the url <a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000">127.0.0.1:3000</a> in the browser of your choice and then you should see CheWeed in action!
